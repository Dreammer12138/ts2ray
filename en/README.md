# v2script Wiki

**V2script** is a typescript-based v2Ray configuration generation package.

In general, configuring v2Ray requires directly modifying the `config.json` file, whereas **v2script** supports programmatically configuring `config.json`. Therefore, it is more suitable for building v2Ray automation scripts or visualization applications.

All configurations of **v2cript** are designed and developed according to the official documents of [v2ray](https://www.v2fly.org/). Therefore, if **v2script** is not precise or detailed, you can refer to the official website for detailed configurations.

Of course, **v2cript** still has some shortcomings. If you have better ideas and suggestions, you are welcome to contribute code.

If my work is of any help to you, please don't be stingy with a **Star‚≠ê**.
