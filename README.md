## Introduction

Typescript v2sub is a v2ray configuration generation package based on typescript.

Unlike the usual manual modification of config.json files to configure v2ray, TypeScript v2sub supports programmatic methods to configure config.json. This will provide you with help in building v2ray automation control scripts and visualization tools.

All configurations of Typescript v2sub are developed based on the official [v2ray](https://v2ray.com/) documentation.

Of course, Typescript v2sub still has some shortcomings. If you have better ideas and suggestions, you are welcome to contribute the code.
